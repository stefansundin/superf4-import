When enabled, press Ctrl+Alt+F4 to kill the process of the currently selected window.
The effect is the same as when you kill the process from the task manager.

You can use -hide as a parameter to hide the tray icon.

Changelog
---------
0.8:
Made the detection of Ctrl+Alt+F4 more secure, preventing faulty kills which could happen when SuperF4 didn't receive the keyup of the F4 key.
Only one instance of SuperF4 can now be run. Starting SuperF4 again will make the first instance add its tray icon if hidden.

0.7:
keyhook now tries to get the SeDebugPrivilege privilege, allowing more programs to be killed.

0.6:
Small fix to prevent the key pressed from being propagated to another window after terminating the process.

0.5:
Fixed a rare case where SuperF4 would kill a program when the user pressed Alt+F4.

0.4:
Option to autostart SuperF4. Can hide tray icon in current session.

0.3:
The tray icon can be hidden with -hide as a parameter.

Tray icon is now readded when explorer crashes.
