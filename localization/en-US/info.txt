SuperF4
Made by Stefan Sundin

Press Ctrl+Alt+F4 to kill the process of the currently selected window.
The effect is the same as when you kill the process from the task manager.

You can also kill a process by pressing [the windows key]+F4 and then clicking the window with the mouse.
You can press escape or the right mouse button to exit this mode without killing a program.

SuperF4 will automatically check for updates.
You can disable this in SuperF4.ini.

You can use -hide as a parameter to hide the tray icon.
